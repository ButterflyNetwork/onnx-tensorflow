# NOT FOR GENERAL USE!
This is a custom fork of `onnx-tensorflow` intended to resolve issues with the conversion of a specific
model to TFLite, specifically resolving performance and memory leak issues identified with a specific
partner project.  It IS NOT intended for use with any other model, and will (in all likelihood) break
in many unexpected ways if applied to any other model.

Please see [the original readme](https://github.com/onnx/onnx-tensorflow) for any more details on
usage.
